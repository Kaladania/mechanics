As response to feedback

- Fixed game breaking grenade bug by changing blast radius collission to ignore everything except the player, enemies and crystals (instead of doing manual checks)
- Increased crystal consumption to reduce increase the difficulty of managing the reasource
- Increased the auto projectile size and damage dealt in order to make it easier to usea


Added sound effects to increase game juicyness
- tried to find effects that sounded high pitched enough to feel like it came from a sci-fi weapon, but 'ground'/flat enough to feel powerful/like it was shot with a real gun
	- fits the aesthetic of the level: a sci-fi world grounded by the remnants of a 'real world' dystopia


Got lecturer feedback on my broken fireball
- learnt that the reason the enemy was not homing is because the timeline was competing with the projectile component for movement priority - causing the enemy to stay in place
	- Deactivating the component to let the timeline play, then reactivating it once the player was spotted allowed it to work
- However, learnt of a flaw in enemy in that currently the projectile can only go down, not up
	- means if the player is too far away, the fireball will end up underneath the player
		- not a huge concern considering this is supposed to be an explosive enemy so damage will be done via a blast radius
		- however could be annoying if the player was being continously targeted/ambushed by enemies they have not encountered yet
			- therefore opted to drastically reduce the attack radius to ensure that the player fully notices the fireball before they are attack

	- Thinking about balancing made me realise that this enemy would be hard to fend off with a gun
		- while I intend to set it so that the enemy explodes on contact with projectiles, players may find it more enjoyable to defend against explosions with shields

	- would also give more priority to the shield developement as having a shield was suggested by some play testers due to the enslaught of enemies
		- would also make the boss fight more enjoyable as bullet hells/bosses are not as fun to deal with when you have no option for defense/invisibility frames

	- Decided to use shield developement to slightly rework alt system
		- while play testers enjoyed the crystal management, they did not make much use of the alt weapon due to how similar it was to the main weapon
			- I don't want alt weapons to drastically differ from the main weapon as it would defeat the purpose of calling them 'alts'
				- would also introudce more work to do for balancing and bug testing, work that I do not feel I have enough time left to do adequatly
			- Therefore decided to have right shift spawn a shield instead of a weapon-dependant alt
				- thinking about reworking the key command for the shield as a play tester felt that the right-shift combination was a bit cumbersome and unusual to use
