Use event triggered for rapid fire spray
- triggers the event per click
	- so for every frame the mouse is held down



Can use Crystals as power source for charge canon
- To add more variety and make the game stand out, crystals are enhancers
	- when enable, the effect each gun in a different way
		- base gun allows for a chain of bullets?
		- automatic gun spawns 3 bullets instead of one
		 - cannon gun can be charged for a massive bullet


Made an automatic that rapid fired smaller bullets
- for balancing reasons
	- made the bullets smaller (with a smaller hit radius)
	- made the bullets deal 1/4 of normal damage (needing more successful hits)
	- also ensured that this weapon didn't make the game too easy by making it so that healing crystals can't be broken with the bullets
- due to increased amount of spawning also reduced life span
	- decreased memory usage


Decided to revet the starter weapon back to a manual gun
- provided more constrast in playstyle against the automatic


Left the cannon with the automatic code but altered the timer to 1.5 seconds
- time enforces a relod
- also ensures that player cannot spam the cannont by repeatedly clicking (this would've happended with the manual code)


Ensured that the weapon pickups cannot be destroyed (didn't think it fit with the game loop)
Move the point light from the parent class to the child class

Updated the cannon weapon to be able to hit two items before its destroyed
- will still be destroyed if it hits a wall
- Attempts were failing as the cannon either stopped when it collided with a single object, collide with multiple objects but bounce in a different direction, or not collide with the object at all (depending on the attempt)
- recieved feedback stating that the cannon would need to use an overlay system instead of hit to prevent the object from stopping.
- set the canon to overlay everything apart from the worldstatic (level objects)
	- told the blueprint to revert collission back to block (ignore player and enemy projectile) to return to the default project tile setting
- had problems with the enemy radars triggering the collision (due to object type being worldstatic)
	- set the radars to 'detection' as they are only used to detect the player's presence

- realised some issues with previous creations
	- the enemy radars need to be changed to 'detection' because they are not real world objects (purely only to 'detect' the player)
	- crystals are 'destrutable' objects so they are given the 'destructable' type
	- the crystals need a parent class because they all share the same values apart from their appearence

Also gave lava a parent class for the same reason


Ran into issues where destroying a crystal would not allow the player to heal, but running into one will
- Realised that this was because I had left the 'on hit' event code in
	- altered the event to only run if the projectile hits the crystal


Plan to ask for help in next lesson to provide ability to use space bar to toggle between guns


Lesson taught about rotating movement component which is a much better way to rotate fans (blueprint used event tick) so oped to go with that
- slight downside on note being able to put in a custom speed for each fan
	- desided it wasn't much of an issue as could always create a new class that accepted the custom movement (For now it was not needed)

unreal random float in range


Next to do:
- Toggle between weapons
- More of an ambush during the main level
- Boss Rush
- Possibly look at creating a mechanic where the crystals can either be used for healing or for damage increase
- Look at making the lower floor tech rougher (currently really metatlic)
- Look into adding more animations to help the world feel more alive
	- flashing lights at the damn and mine entrance
	- flowing lava out of the pipes
- Have the crystals regernate somehow
	- possibly have them rise out of the ground
	
	- OR have enemies drop crystals

- Look into having enemies rotate to follow your movements
	- to save proccessing power, take a BOTW approach and have a 'presence' radar that's extreemly vertical. Responsible for alerting the sentinels' attention
	- Create an animation state to show the new alert
		- possibly their materials turn from a dark grey to the intimidating orange as they glow furiosly
