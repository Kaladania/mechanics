Realised the reason why any damage wasn't returning an actor was because I wasn't passing an actor into the node

Found that automatic weapon could be used to cheese the boss fight due to the constant firing
- decided to add a cooldown timer that would limit the rate of constant fire
- admitting is intentially nerfing the weapon to deter people from using it during boss fight
	- in future would like to look at another way of incorporating this


Ran into a problem of not being able to set a timer due to the way weapons are assigned to the player
- weapons being destroyed and respawned meant that data could not be carried over
	- meant that ammo count would reset every time the weapon changed
- Considering the player was already storing the ammo values, decided to move the nodes incrimenting and deincrimenting the count to the player aswell
	- meant that the ammo count would only reset on player death (which is intended)

Was also a problem where could not assign timer event to UI as the weapon would not be constantly existing in the scene for the UI to reference
- attempted to solve this by creating a dummy actor and hiding it in the level
	- blueprint got confused and would switch between referencing the dummy weapon and the autual weapon
		- lead to a bug where sometimes the base weapon parent 'my tank' player reference would have to be used. Other times a local player reference would have to be used
