MINOR:

- Add skulls to the upper level

Create health pickups
- have the user regenerate health by destroying crystals
	- make it so that the crystal takes a few hits to kill
- possibly look at having the crystals regenergate
- possible look at a challenge mode where the crystals DON'T regenerate (limited heals).

BONUS:
- Look at moving enemies
- Look at pick-ups for damage buffs
