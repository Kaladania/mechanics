Got feedback on how to create dynamic niagra systems
- expose the needed variables to allow them to be used in the editor
- Got further feedback on how to use this exposed vairable in a blueprint
	- will allow me to create collission triggers that also scale dynamically

Used the same system to create dynamic systems for the embers and slim/large lava flows
