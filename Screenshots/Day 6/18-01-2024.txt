- Different enemies are affected by the siren in different ways

- Grunt level enemies like Targets and Turrets fire constantly
- Patrol enemies like the Patrol_Guard (and the rotating cannon) will start shooting homing attacks at the player
- Cavalry enemies like the Cannon will start shooting timed beams instead of projectiles

to prevent multiple if state check, opted to go with switches using an enum state (easier to proccess)
- 0: Default state
- 1: High Alert
- 2: Disabled

Used states to allow enemies to determine what attack behaviour to do depending on the state they are activated in

- Added functionality to the siren so that all affected enemys are disabled allowing player brief moment of rest
	- plan to include an 'EMT' like explosusion to add to this

Replaced the equals logic with a IsA node since it effectively did the same thing but required less blueprints
- easier to read and quicker to compute

can set projectiles as homing projectiles using the 'set homing target' node for projectile movement
	- also tick the 'is homing projectile' setting in details for projectile movement.


Enemy/Player Jump
- Use Jump node
	- basically makes the element jump (prebuilt event)
		- to change the details of the jump - go to character movement
			- can be used for a leapfrog enemy that explodes if it hits the player


Add rnadom pauses
- random float node
	- can be used to make things happen incosistently (think of it like using a random number for probability)
