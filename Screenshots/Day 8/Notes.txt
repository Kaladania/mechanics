was going to use event tick to check when the proectile experies but did not want to because event tick is last resort
- used event destroyed instead
- wasn't happy with the effect as it made it seem like the bullet was colliding 

Added sparks to all projectiles
- added blue sparks for player projectile contact
- added orange sparks for enemy contact

Set random sparks to go off to help with enemy pre-explosion animation

Retooled cannon to destroy an overlayed actor (helps with powerful feel)
- plan to further retool in the future to not allow overlays on enemy it can't one shot (such as bosses)

To fit with the low-poly theme made the flowing lava more block like

For enviromental theme added embers 
- set up a way that the enmbers begin to spawn when the player heads near the lava in the first room (room is not full of embers)
- entering the lava room introduces you to a room of embers

Added damage to the flowing lava
- created an empty blueprint and gave it a collission box
- for optimization, set it to ignore everything except the player
