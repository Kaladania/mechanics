blocking volume
- invisible wall
- can help with guiding ai/stops the player from driving out

thinking about creating a new 'homing gun'
- firing the gun creates a projectile point (that doesn't disapear on inpact) that all enemies movetowards to until it disapeears

Added a the BOTW inspired enemy detection mechanic by having a 'low-alert' radar and a 'high-alert' radar

Updated the sentinel enemy by reparenting it to the enemy parent
- Also added QoL features such as settings to change the material, causing enemy to glow when it senses the player and stop glowing when player leaves radar area
	- moved the bobing code to this check to help give the impression that the player's proximity is 'activating' the sentinel
	- having the 'off' mesh be a grey colour also helped sentinel blend in with enviroemtn
		- provided less visual glowing clutter/over-stimulation
		- provided oppertunity /inspiration for 'sneak attack' enemies that hide in the shadows and the player is only made aware when they activate the enemy and its starts to glow


Added agressive patrolling enemies
- combined the random movement to animate the enemy and have them 'on lookout'
- combined the chasing movement to have them pursue the player if caught
	- adds some contrast to game player by introducing sneak strats?

patrol guard
- surveys the area
- pursues the player until they get out of range
- goes back to pursuing the area
- fires rapidly to pressure the player

lookout
- doesn't attack
- surveys the area 
	- decided to also allow some to be offline and hidden in the shadows
		- acts as an enjoyable game play shock as the player is caught off-guard once the sirens go off
- turns on a siren if the player gets to close and pursues relentlessly
	- only way to get ride of the siren is to kill the lookout
- active siren alerts all nearby enemies
	- causes their 'low-priority' radars to turn into 'high-priority' radars
		- makes it harder for the player to sneak past enemies/more likely to get overwhelmed/ambushed.



Next steps
- parent player projectiles and enemy projectiles to make references to them easier
	- i.e using a parent to tell crystals which projectiles it should/should not accept
- add blueprints to turn low-priority radars into high-priority radars
- create a 'decoy' gun that focuses all nearby enemy attention to the player can escape
